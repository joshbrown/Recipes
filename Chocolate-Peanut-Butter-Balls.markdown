Chocolate Peanut Butter Balls
--------------------

>**Prep Time**: 1 hour
>**Total Time**: 1 hour

- 1 cup sifted powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup creamy or crunchy peanut butter
- 3 tablespoons butter or margarine, softened
- 1 pound milk chocolate morsels

Stir together powdered sugar, peanut butter and butter until well mixed. Shape peanut butter mixture into 1 inch balls, placing them on a baking sheet covered with waxed paper. Let balls stand for 20 minutes to dry.

While balls are drying, heat morsels in top of a double boiler. Do not cover. When morsels are fully melted, keep on low until balls are fully dry. Be sure to prevent water from coming in contact with morsels.

Drop balls one at a time into melted morsels. Using a fork, remove from the chocolate, letting excess chocolate drip off. Place back on waxed paper. Let stand until dry.

Store tightly covered in a cool, dry place
