--------------

_by chef MacGregor Mann_

___Serves 4___
## Ingredients

 * 8 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved (about 3/4 cup)
 * 1 bunch parsley, stems removed (about 2 cups)
 * 1 small red onion, sliced
 * 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
 * 1/2 cup jarred baby artichoke hearts, halved
 * Salt and freshly ground pepper
 * 2 1/4 cups low-sodium chicken stock
 * 1/2 teaspoons saffron
 * 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
 * 1/2 pound fresh Spanish chorizo, cut into 1/4-inch slices
 * 1 small onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)
 * 6 garlic cloves, minced (about 1/4 cup)
 * 1 cup calaspara or Arborio rice
 * 1/4 cup fresh or frozen peas
 * 1/4 jarred piquillo pepper, thinly sliced
 * 10 ounces shredded cooked chicken (about 2 cups)
 
## Directions

 1. Make the parsley salad: In a large mixing bowl, toss the cherry tomatoes with the parsley, onion, vinegar and artichoke hearts. Season with salt and pepper and toss again. Let stand at room temperature while you make the paella.
 
 2. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;. In a small saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer. Remove the stock from heat, stir in the saffron, cover and set aside.
 
 3. In a large, heavy skillet or paella pan, combine the olive oil, chorizo, onion and garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens and the chorizo begins to brown, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add the rice and mix to coat the grains completely.
 
 4. Stir in the reserved chicken stock, peas, pepper and chicken; season with salt and pepper. Covert the pan and bake for 15 minutes. Uncover and bake until edges are golden brown and the rice is cooked through, about 25 to 30 minutes. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Top the paella with the parsley salad and service immediately.
